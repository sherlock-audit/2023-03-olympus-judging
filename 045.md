# Abuse decreaseTotalLp for DOS

## Summary

The function `decreaseTotalLp` is called on withdraw of vaults and reverts if amount withdrawn exceeds total LP stored by the vault manager. This assumes that the withdrawn LP have been deposited by the user before, which may be wrong.

A user can LP token on Balancer and reward tokens on Aura, transfer them to the vault (without using the `deposit()` function) and `withdraw()` them to break accounting. If the user lowers `totalLp` to 0, no other user will be able to withdraw their LP.

## Vulnerability Detail

`withdraw()` decreases totalLP on the manager:

The totalLP tracking assume withdrawn LP were once deposited and reverts on unexpected value:

Aura reward pool`stakeFor()` can be used to increase `_balances[vault]`, allowing the vault to withdraw from aura without having deposited:
https://github.com/aurafinance/convex-platform/blob/c17d05039f8ed5cda8fdebb72e0a17f0119521b9/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L196-L227

Withdraw function of Aura reward checks for `_balances[msg.sender]` and calls `withdrawTo` on Booser:
https://github.com/aurafinance/convex-platform/blob/c17d05039f8ed5cda8fdebb72e0a17f0119521b9/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L260-L285

Withdraw function of Booster (called by `withdrawTo`) burns the pool token, which could have been transferred by the user:
https://github.com/aurafinance/convex-platform/blob/c17d05039f8ed5cda8fdebb72e0a17f0119521b9/contracts/contracts/Booster.sol#L483-L509

The rest of the `wihtdraw()` function of BLVaultLido will run smoothly without specific care from the attacker, it exits the balancer pool using the LP token received from Aura and repays the wstETH / OHM.

## Impact

Users can break the tracking of `totalLp` in the vault manager, preventing other users to withdraw.

The cost of the attack to the user is limited, they mint LP tokens, stake them, and eventually get wstETH back. They lose 50% of the value of the withdraw since they receive only the wstETH and not the OHM (which they had to LP). However, it is sufficient that a user perform this attack with a value of `1` with negligible costs to break accounting.

## Recommendation

Add tracking of deposits and withdraw within user vaults so that they can only withdraw what they deposited.
